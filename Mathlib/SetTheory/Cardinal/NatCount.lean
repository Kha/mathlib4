# Counting on ℕ

This file defines the `count` function, which gives, for any predicate on the natural numbers,
"how many numbers under `k` satisfy this predicate?".
We then prove several expected lemmas about `count`, relating it to the cardinality of other
objects, and helping to evaluate it for specific `k`.
